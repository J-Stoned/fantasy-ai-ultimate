2025-07-03 14:31:05.704493: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI AVX512_BF16 FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
