## ‚öæ MLB Stats Field Names (games.sport = "MLB")

### ‚ùå DATA CORRUPTION DETECTED!
**MLB data contains BASKETBALL fields instead of baseball:**
- `points`, `field_goals_made`, `rebounds`, `assists` (WRONG!)
- `fantasy_points`, `minutes_played`, `blocks`, `steals` (WRONG!)

**This needs to be fixed before MLB metrics can be calculated.**

## üìù CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

### üö® QUERY STRATEGY:
**ALWAYS use `games.sport` NOT `players.sport` for multi-sport queries!**
```sql
-- CORRECT:
SELECT * FROM player_game_logs pgl
JOIN games g ON pgl.game_id = g.id  
WHERE g.sport = 'NBA'

-- WRONG:
SELECT * FROM player_game_logs pgl
JOIN players p ON pgl.player_id = p.id
WHERE p.sport = 'NBA'
```

### üîß DATA TYPE CONVERSIONS NEEDED:
1. **NHL `timeOnIce`**: String ‚Üí Number (MM:SS format)
2. **NFL defensive stats**: All strings ‚Üí Numbers  
3. **Always use parseFloat()** - some numbers stored as strings

### üèÄ BASKETBALL DISCOVERY ISSUE:
- Earlier we found NBA uses `fieldGoalsAttempted` (camelCase)
- But games.sport="NBA" shows `field_goals_attempted` (snake_case)
- **Two different NBA datasets exist!** Need to check both patterns.

### üìä DATA CORRUPTION ISSUES:
- **MLB contains basketball stats** - needs data cleanup
- **Multiple NFL formats** - handle both uppercase/lowercase variants

### üéØ SPORTS PRIORITY ORDER:
1. **NBA** - 15,288 logs (best data)
2. **NFL** - Two formats available  
3. **NHL** - Clean camelCase data
4. **MLB** - SKIP until data fixed
5. **NCAA** - Research needed
