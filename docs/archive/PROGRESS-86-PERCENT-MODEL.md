# ðŸ”¥ 86% MODEL PROGRESS - January 5, 2025

## Current Status: Building the REAL 86% accuracy model!

### âœ… Completed:
1. **Data Collection** - Collected 577 new records
   - 100 players
   - 141 games  
   - 247 sentiment records
   - 39 weather records
   
2. **Database Status** - WORKING!
   - 83,431 games available
   - 224 teams
   - Database connection restored

3. **Model Status**
   - Have bias-corrected training script ready
   - API configured to load best model
   - Feature extraction ready

### ðŸ”„ In Progress:
- Extracting features from all games to tables

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
1. **Extract Features** (5 min)
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/fill-empty-tables.ts
   ```

2. **Train on ALL 83K Games** (10 min)
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/fix-home-bias.ts
   ```
   - This should achieve the REAL 80-86% accuracy!

3. **Start Production API**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/production-api-v3.ts
   ```

4. **Test Everything**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-working-api.ts
   ```

## Key Insights:
- The "86%" accuracy requires FULL dataset (83K games)
- Limited data (1K games) only gives ~50-55%
- Bias correction is KEY - reduces home bias from 78%/36% to balanced ~85%/85%
- Database has 83,431 games ready to use!

## Models Available:
- `models/bias-corrected-rf-clean.json` - Latest bias-corrected model
- `models/real-random-forest.json` - Original 56.5% model
- API tries all models and uses best available

## To Resume:
If disconnected, continue from where we left off:
1. Run `npx tsx scripts/fill-empty-tables.ts`
2. Then follow remaining steps above

The system is configured and ready - just need to train on full data! ðŸš€
