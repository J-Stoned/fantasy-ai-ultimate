*Last Updated: January 9, 2025 4:48 PM*

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY

### 1. Base Collector Class ‚úÖ
- Created unified base collector with proper database schema mapping
- Supports integer IDs (not UUIDs) - matching production schema
- Includes Bloom filter for deduplication
- Cache management with TTL
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Batch operations support
- **Tested and verified working with database**

### 2. NFL Master Collector ‚úÖ
- Integrates Sleeper API for player data
- Integrates ESPN API for games and stats
- Handles proper ID mappings
- Calculates fantasy points
- Comprehensive stat parsing for all positions
- Photo URL generation for all players

### 3. Database Compatibility ‚úÖ
- Verified integer ID types work correctly
- Player insertion: ‚úÖ
- Game insertion: ‚úÖ
- Game log insertion: ‚úÖ
- All fields map correctly to schema

## üìä CURRENT DATA STATUS

### Players
- Total: 22,143 (real players, excluding test data)
- With photos: 14,009 (63.3%)
- NFL: 11,824 players (46.1% with photos)

### Games
- Total: 86,795
- Completed: 52,359
- Need stats for: ~52,000 games

### Player Game Logs (CRITICAL)
- Current: 1,134 (0.11% coverage)
- Target: 1,047,180 (100% coverage)
- **This is the bottleneck for pattern detection accuracy**

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next Hour)
1. Run NFL collector on sample data (100 games)
2. Verify stats are being collected properly
3. Check fantasy point calculations

### Today
1. Create NBA master collector
2. Create MLB master collector with free MLB Stats API
3. Create NHL master collector with free NHL Stats API
4. Test all collectors with small samples

### This Week
1. Implement worker thread parallelization
2. Add batch insert operations (10K records at once)
3. Scale up to collect ALL game stats
4. Add monitoring dashboard

## üìÅ FILES CREATED

1. `/scripts/collectors/base-collector.ts` - Base class for all collectors
2. `/scripts/collectors/nfl-master-collector.ts` - NFL data collection
3. `/scripts/test-nfl-collector.ts` - NFL collector test
4. `/scripts/test-base-collector.ts` - Base functionality test
5. `/PROJECT-STATUS-10X-PLAN.md` - Comprehensive plan
6. `/CURRENT-STATUS.md` - This file

## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

### Working Configuration
```typescript
// Database uses integer IDs
player.id: number
game.id: number
player_game_logs.player_id: number
player_game_logs.game_id: number

// Key field mappings
players.firstname (not first_name)
players.lastname (not last_name)
players.photo_url (not headshot_url)
players.team (not team_name)
```

### API Limits
- ESPN: No limit (using 10 concurrent)
- Sleeper: No limit (can scale to 100+)
- NHL Stats API: Unlimited (FREE!)
- MLB Stats API: Unlimited (FREE!)

## üö® CRITICAL PATH TO 76.4% ACCURACY

1. **Collect game logs** - Need 1M+ records
2. **Process with patterns** - Run pattern detection
3. **Achieve target** - 65.2% ‚Üí 76.4% accuracy
