### 📊 Results

- **Before**: 650+ files in scripts directory
- **After**: 447 files (31% reduction)
- **Organized**: Files now in logical directories
- **Cleaner**: Removed all temporary/redundant files

### 🎯 What's Left

The scripts directory still contains many files that could be further organized:
- ML/AI training scripts
- API service scripts
- Data collection scripts
- Pattern detection scripts

These can be organized in a future cleanup phase based on active usage.

### ✨ Benefits

1. **Easier Navigation** - Files organized by function
2. **No Duplicates** - Removed redundant implementations
3. **Clear Structure** - Logical directory hierarchy
4. **Maintainable** - Easier to find and update files
