# Schema Alignment Progress Report

## Summary
We've made significant progress aligning the database schema to support both the existing simple schema and the desired complex schema features.

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### 1. **Analyzed Current Schema State**
- Database uses INTEGER primary keys (not UUIDs)
- Simple schema from `20250102_create_missing_tables.sql` is active
- 8,858 player_stats records using stat_type/stat_value structure
- Missing external_id columns for API mappings

### 2. **Created Data Backups**
- Backed up 30,019 records across 7 tables
- Backup location: `backups/backup_summary_2025-07-03T15-42-24-144Z.json`
- Includes: player_stats, players, games, teams, weather_data, etc.

### 3. **Designed Migration Strategy**
- Decision: Enhanced Simple Schema approach
- Keep integer IDs for compatibility
- Add complex features as extensions
- Created `enhance-schema-for-complex-features.sql`

### 4. **Built Schema Adapter Layer**
- Location: `lib/db/schema-adapter.ts`
- Provides unified interface for both schemas
- Handles player/game creation with external IDs
- Supports both old and new player stats structures

### 5. **Updated ESPN Collector**
- Created `espn-collector-enhanced.ts`
- Uses schema adapter for compatibility
- Supports NFL and NBA data collection
- Handles external ID mappings properly

## Pending Tasks üìã

### 6. **Apply Schema Enhancements**
**Action Required**: Run `scripts/enhance-schema-for-complex-features.sql` in Supabase Dashboard
This will add:
- external_id columns to players, games, teams
- player_platform_mapping table
- player_game_logs table (complex schema feature)
- player_season_stats table
- Helper functions and views

### 7. **Update BallDontLie Collector**
Similar to ESPN collector updates

### 8. **Migrate Player Stats**
After schema enhancements are applied:
- Convert stat_type/stat_value to JSONB in player_game_logs
- Aggregate into season stats

### 9. **Update ML Training**
Use schema adapter to work with both formats

## Key Files Created

1. **Schema Analysis**
   - `scripts/analyze-current-schema.ts`
   - `scripts/schema-alignment-strategy.md`

2. **Backup Scripts**
   - `scripts/backup-current-data.ts`
   - `backups/` directory with JSON exports

3. **Migration Scripts**
   - `scripts/enhance-schema-for-complex-features.sql`
   - `scripts/apply-schema-enhancements.ts`
   - `scripts/verify-enhancements.ts`

4. **Adapter Layer**
   - `lib/db/schema-adapter.ts`

5. **Enhanced Collectors**
   - `scripts/espn-collector-enhanced.ts`

## Next Steps

1. **Manual SQL Execution**
   ```bash
   # Copy this file's contents:
   scripts/enhance-schema-for-complex-features.sql
   
   # Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   # Then verify:
   npx tsx scripts/verify-enhancements.ts
   ```

2. **Test Enhanced Collection**
   ```bash
   # After schema enhancements:
   npx tsx scripts/espn-collector-enhanced.ts
   ```

3. **Complete Migration**
   - Update remaining collectors
   - Migrate existing player_stats data
   - Update ML training scripts

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Breaking Changes** - Existing functionality continues to work
2. **Gradual Migration** - Can move to complex schema over time
3. **API Compatibility** - External IDs enable proper API mappings
4. **Performance** - Better indexes and JSONB storage
5. **Flexibility** - Supports both simple and complex queries

## Technical Debt Addressed

- ‚úÖ Schema mismatch between design and implementation
- ‚úÖ No external ID tracking for API data
- ‚úÖ Limited player stats structure
- ‚úÖ Missing season aggregations
- ‚úÖ Poor API data mapping

## Risks Mitigated

- ‚ùå Breaking existing functionality (avoided)
- ‚ùå Data loss during migration (backed up)
- ‚ùå Complex UUID migration (using hybrid approach)
- ‚ùå Collector incompatibility (adapter layer handles this)
