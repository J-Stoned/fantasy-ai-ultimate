-- First, let's see what we're dealing with
SELECT COUNT(*) as fake_games_count

-- Delete related player_stats DIRECTLY (this might take a while)
DELETE FROM player_stats 
WHERE game_id IN (

);

-- Delete related player_game_logs DIRECTLY
DELETE FROM player_game_logs

-- NOW DELETE ALL FAKE GAMES AT ONCE
DELETE FROM games WHERE external_id IS NULL;
