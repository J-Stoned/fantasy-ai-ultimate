‚úÖ Advanced Analytics Infrastructure Ready:
- Enhanced collector template with real-time metrics
- Cross-sport universal metrics defined
- Sport-specific advanced analytics ready
- Storage optimization plan created

‚ö†Ô∏è Data Quality Issues Found:
- 159,758 logs missing opponent_id (mostly old data)
- Many logs missing team_id and is_home fields
- Need to ensure new collectors populate all fields

üìã Next Steps:
1. Use enhanced collector template for ALL new data
2. Add new sports with complete metrics from the start
3. Backfill advanced metrics for existing quality data
4. Focus on quality over quantity going forward
