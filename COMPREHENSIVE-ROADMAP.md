## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Week 1)

### 1. Fix NCAA Height Parser Bug
```typescript
// Current issue: height data is not always a string
private parseHeight(heightStr?: string | number): number | undefined {
  if (!heightStr) return undefined;
  
  // Handle both string and number inputs
  const height = typeof heightStr === 'string' ? heightStr : String(heightStr);
  const match = height.match(/(\d+)'?\s*(\d+)?/);
  // ... rest of implementation
}
```

const numWorkers = os.cpus().length * 2;
const workers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numWorkers; i++) {
  workers.push(new Worker('./collector-worker.js'));
}

// Distribute work across threads
const queue = new PQueue({ concurrency: numWorkers });
```

### 2. Batch Database Operations
