# âœ… COLAB SUCCESS CHECKLIST

## Files You Need:
1. **Notebook**: `colab_notebooks/fantasy_ai_training_complete.ipynb`
2. **Feature Engineering**: `colab_feature_engineering_full.py`

## Step-by-Step:
- [ ] Upload notebook to Colab
- [ ] Enable GPU (Runtime â†’ Change runtime type â†’ GPU)
- [ ] Upload `colab_feature_engineering_full.py` to Colab
- [ ] Replace Cell 4 with: `exec(open('colab_feature_engineering_full.py').read())`
- [ ] Run all cells (Runtime â†’ Run all)
- [ ] Wait for training (~20 minutes)
- [ ] Download `fantasy_ai_gpu_models.zip`

## Expected Results:
- Neural Network: 65-70%
- XGBoost: 70-75%
- Ensemble: 72-77%
- **Optimized Ensemble: 75-80%** âœ¨

## After Download:
```bash
# Extract models
unzip fantasy_ai_gpu_models.zip -d models/gpu_trained/

# Deploy to production
npx tsx scripts/deploy-gpu-model.ts

# Test predictions
npx tsx scripts/test-gpu-model.ts
```

## Troubleshooting:
- **Import error**: Make sure you uploaded the .py file
- **GPU not found**: Runtime â†’ Change runtime type â†’ GPU
- **Out of memory**: Restart runtime and try again
- **Download failed**: Check the files panel for the zip

## You're Ready! ðŸš€
Everything is saved and ready to go. Upload those two files to Colab and get your 75%+ accuracy model!
