    conrelid::regclass AS table_name,
    confrelid::regclass AS referenced_table,
    pg_get_constraintdef(oid) as definition
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE contype = 'f'
AND (conrelid::regclass::text LIKE '%teams%' 
     OR confrelid::regclass::text LIKE '%teams%');

SELECT 
    inhrelid::regclass as child_table,

FROM pg_inherits
WHERE inhrelid::regclass::text LIKE '%teams%'
OR inhparent::regclass::text LIKE '%teams%';

-- 4. List both tables' structures side by side
SELECT 
    '=== TEAMS TABLE ===' as table_info,

FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'teams'

ORDER BY ordinal_position;

SELECT 
    '=== TEAMS_MASTER TABLE ===' as table_info,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
