# ðŸ¤– ANTHROPIC AI ASSISTANT SETUP

## âœ… Integration Complete!

The AI Assistant has been successfully updated to use Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus instead of OpenAI.

## What Changed:

1. **API Endpoint** (`/api/ai/chat/route.ts`)
   - Now uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 
   - Configured for Claude 3 Opus model
   - Proper error handling for Anthropic API

2. **Frontend** (`/app/ai-assistant/page.tsx`)
   - Updated to show "Powered by Claude 3 Opus"
   - Same user experience, better AI backend

3. **API Client** (`/lib/api/client.ts`)
   - Already configured to work with either provider

## To Use:

1. **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify Your API Key** in `.env.local`:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR-KEY-HERE
   ```

3. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:web
   ```

4. **Test the AI Assistant**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/ai-assistant
   - Try asking questions like:
     - "What patterns are hot today?"
     - "Explain the Back-to-Back Fade pattern"
     - "Help me optimize my DraftKings lineup"

## Why Claude is Better for Fantasy AI:

- **Superior Context Understanding** - Handles complex fantasy scenarios better
- **More Detailed Analysis** - Provides deeper statistical insights
- **Consistent Expertise** - Maintains fantasy sports expert persona
- **Larger Context Window** - Can analyze entire seasons of data

## Test Commands:

```bash
# Quick API test (when server is running)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is Back-to-Back Fade?"}]}'

# Full test suite
npm run test:ai
```

## Troubleshooting:

1. **"Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/sdk'"**
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check your API key is correct in `.env.local`
   - Make sure it starts with `sk-ant-api03-`

3. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - Claude has rate limits, wait a moment and try again
   - Consider upgrading your Anthropic plan

## Success! ðŸŽ‰
