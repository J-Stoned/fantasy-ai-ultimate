# ðŸš€ Fantasy AI Ultimate - Database Migration Guide

## Quick Start - Run Migrations in Supabase

### 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/pvekvqiqrrpugfmpgaup/editor

### 2. Run Migrations in Order

#### Option A: Run Combined File (Easiest)
1. Copy entire contents of `supabase/all_migrations.sql`
2. Paste in SQL Editor
3. Click "Run"

#### Option B: Run Individual Files
Run these files in order:
1. `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` - Core tables
2. `supabase/migrations/002_additional_data_tables.sql` - Additional tables
3. `supabase/migrations/003_performance_indexes.sql` - Performance optimizations
4. `supabase/seed.sql` - Initial data (optional)

### 3. Verify Installation
Run this query to check all tables were created:
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

You should see 60+ tables including:
- players
- teams_master
- leagues
- sports
- fantasy_leagues
- fantasy_teams
- player_stats
- player_game_logs
- And many more...

### 4. Check Indexes
```sql
SELECT indexname, tablename 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

## What Gets Created

### ðŸ“Š Core Tables (60+)
- **Player Management**: players, player_stats, player_game_logs, player_injuries
- **Sports Hierarchy**: sports, leagues, teams_master, conferences, divisions
- **Fantasy Integration**: fantasy_leagues, fantasy_teams, player_platform_mapping
- **Data Collection**: player_news, social_mentions, weather_data, betting_odds
- **Analytics**: player_trends, matchup_history, ml_predictions

### ðŸš€ Performance Features
- **20+ Composite Indexes** for fast queries
- **Partial Indexes** for active records
- **GIN Indexes** for JSON searches
- **Materialized Views** for expensive aggregations
- **Database Functions** for complex operations

### ðŸ”§ Optimizations for Small Instance
- Indexes target most common query patterns
- Materialized views cache expensive calculations
- Functions reduce round-trip queries
- Partial indexes minimize index size

## Next Steps After Migration

### 1. Generate Prisma Client
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/st0ne/Hey\ Fantasy/fantasy-ai-ultimate
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Test Database Connection
```bash
npm run test:db
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure your IP is whitelisted in Supabase
- Check DATABASE_URL in .env.local
- Try using pooled connection for app queries

### Migration Errors
- Check for existing tables/types before re-running
- Drop all tables to start fresh: `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;`
- Check Supabase logs for detailed errors

## Database Size Estimates

With Small instance (4GB):
- ~2.5M player records
- ~50M stat records
- ~100M game logs
- Efficient with proper indexing and caching

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Supabase logs
2. Verify all environment variables
3. Ensure migrations ran in correct order
