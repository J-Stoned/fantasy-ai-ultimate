### To Use Full Database Features:

#### Option 1: Quick Fix (Use Supabase Client)
The app already works with Supabase client for most operations. Just use it as-is!

#### Option 2: Enable Supabase Connection Pooling
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pvekvqiqrrpugfmpgaup/settings/database
2. Find "Connection Pooling" section
3. Enable it and set to "Session" mode
4. Copy the pooler connection string
5. Update your `.env.local` with the new URL

#### Option 3: Fix WSL2 Networking
Run in Windows PowerShell as Admin:
```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=5432 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=5432 connectaddress=172.17.0.2
```

## 📝 Summary:

**Your Fantasy AI Ultimate is WORKING!** 

- All code issues are fixed ✅
- Import paths are correct ✅
- APIs are responding ✅
- UI is loading ✅
- Database works via REST API ✅

The only limitation is direct PostgreSQL connections due to WSL2 networking, which doesn't affect the app's functionality when using Supabase client.
